Bugfix
   * Fix a bug in (D)TLS curve negotiation: when MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO was
     enabled and an ECDHE-ECDSA or ECDHE-RSA key exchange was used, the
     client would fail to check that the curve selected by the server for
     ECDHE was indeed one that was offered. As a result, the client would
     accept any curve that it supported, even if that curve was not allowed
     according to its configuration.
