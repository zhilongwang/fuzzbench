  """Runs OSS-Fuzz project's fuzzers for CI tools.
  This is the entrypoint for the run_fuzzers github action.
  This action can be added to any OSS-Fuzz project's workflow that uses Github.

  NOTE: libfuzzer binaries must be located in the ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/out
  directory in order for this action to be used. This action will only fuzz the
  binary's that are located in that directory. It is reccomended that you add
  the build_fuzzers action preceding this one.

  NOTE: Any crash report will be in the filepath:
  ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/out/testcase
  This can be used in parallel with the upload-artifact action to surface the
  logs.

  Required environment variables:
    FUZZ_SECONDS: The length of time in seconds that fuzzers are to be run.
    GITHUB_WORKSPACE: The shared volume directory where input artifacts are.
    DRY_RUN: If true, no failures will surface.
    OSS_FUZZ_PROJECT_NAME: The name of the relevant OSS-Fuzz project.
    SANITIZER: The sanitizer to use when running fuzzers.

  Returns:
    0 on success or 1 on Failure.
